// StudioRecorder resolves each click's position from the cursor track at the same
// instant, so the two always agree.

// It opens devices with a PLAIN open (no EVIOCGRAB): it observes input, never
// steals it. Compile-guarded on HAVE_LIBINPUT — without it the class is inert
// (start() does nothing, no signal ever fires), so the recorder can own and wire
// one unconditionally and only ever start it when InputPermission == Available.
